This game project was a collaboration between Jamey Manh Nguyen and Bui Nhat Anh, two Computer Science sophomores at Iowa State University.
This project was a 48 hour game jam hosted in late October, where we made a game with the word "club" centered as the theme of this game. 
During this game jam, we used Github for source control, and Unity for our game engine. The game was a poker-esque card game where we learned how to piece together game objects, logic scripts, create a UI, a tutorial for the game, import game assets,
and create a turn-based fighting system with an enemy and player.
